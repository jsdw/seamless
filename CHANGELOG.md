# v0.2.0

- Allow the expected HTTP method for a route to be configured by implementors of the `Body` trait.
  (previously it was always POST if a `Body` was provided, else GET).
- Remove `IntoApiError` and implement `From<T>` as appropriate instead.
- Remove `Method` enum and use `http::method::Method` in its place.
